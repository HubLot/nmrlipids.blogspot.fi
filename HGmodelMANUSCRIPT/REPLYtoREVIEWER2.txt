The title of our manuscript is:
"Towards atomistic resolution structure of
phosphatidylcholine headgroup and glycerol
backbone at different ambient conditions"
in the introduction we write:
"Phospholipid molecules are composed of hydrophobic acyl chains connected
by a glycerol backbone to a hydrophilic headgroup ..."
This is widely used naming convention for phospholipid molecules.
According to the title and the naming convetion used in the manuscript, 
the beginning of acyl chains are not the part of headgroup and are 
beoynd the scope defined in the title. Their presence at the interface
or their chemical environment do not change this.

We are not willing to extend the scope of the manuscript since it
would signifincantly increase already massive information content and 
length. Instead, the acyl chains order parameters will be discussed in 
the context of the NMRLipids III project, see
